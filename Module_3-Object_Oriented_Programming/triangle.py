Lab Exercise 7 - Triangle

Now we're going to embed the Point class (see Lab 3.4.1.14) inside another
class. Also, we're going to put three points into one class, which will let
us define a triangle. How can we do it?

The new class will be called Triangle and this is what we want:

the constructor accepts three arguments â€“ all of them are objects of the
Point class;
the points are stored inside the object as a private list;
the class provides a parameterless method called perimeter(),
which calculates the perimeter of the triangle described by the three points;
the perimeter is the sum of all the lengths of the legs (we mention this for
the record, although we are sure that you know it perfectly yourself.)
